### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joe.

I'm a Software Engineer living in the United Kingdom that loves all things backend/network and distributed systems related.

I currently work remotely as a Lead Engineer at [Form3](https://www.form3.tech/) helping build and support their highly reliable multicloud Payment Processing Platform. Prior to that I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Just Eat Takeaway](https://www.justeattakeaway.com/).

I love writing Go day-to-day but enjoy experimenting with other languages too and I especially enjoy contributing to open-source software.

#### How to reach me?

You can find me actively discussing software engineering related topics at [@_josephwoodward](https://twitter.com/_josephwoodward) on Twitter, occasionally blogging over at [josephwoodward.co.uk](https://josephwoodward.co.uk) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-woodward2/).
